# Frontend Mentor Submission - News Webpage

This repository contains the code for a simple news webpage. This project was created as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. Below, you will find information on the project structure, HTML structure, CSS styles, and a brief description of the webpage.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: This CSS file contains the styles for the webpage.
- Images: The `img` folder contains various images used in the webpage.
- `favicon-32x32.png`: The favicon for the webpage.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) is structured as follows:

- `head`: Contains metadata, title, and links to external stylesheets and the favicon.
- `body`: Contains the main content of the webpage.

The main content is divided into the following sections:

1. **Header Section** (`div.header`): This section contains the website logo and a navigation menu with buttons for Home, New, Popular, Trending, and Categories.

2. **Middle Section** (`div.middle`): This is the main content area of the webpage and is further divided into two columns.
   - **Left Content** (`div.left-content`): This column contains an image (`img.img-1`) and a footer text with a title and description.
   - **Right Content** (`div.right-content`): This column displays news articles with titles and descriptions.

3. **Footer Section** (`div.Footer`): The footer section is divided into three subsections, each containing an image and information about a topic.

## CSS Styles

The `style.css` file contains styles to format and layout the webpage. It includes styling for buttons, header, content columns, article titles, descriptions, and the footer. The CSS file is organized with comments to describe each section of styles.

## Webpage Description

The webpage is a news portal that features articles and information about various topics. It has a user-friendly header menu for easy navigation and a visually appealing layout. The articles are presented in a clean and organized manner in the right content column, making it easy for users to browse and read.

Additionally, the footer section showcases three different topics with accompanying images and brief descriptions, providing users with additional content to explore.

This code can serve as a starting point for building a news webpage or as a template for similar projects. It follows best practices for HTML and CSS structuring and styling.
